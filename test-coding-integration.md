# Coding Question Integration Test Results

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. "Body already consumed" Error
- **Problem**: Line 29 read `req.json()`, then line 54 tried to read it again for `auto_tag` type
- **Fix**: Extract all data from single `requestBody` object including `questionData`
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. autoTagQuestion Function
- **Problem**: Function was referenced but incomplete
- **Fix**: Complete implementation that analyzes question content and returns skills/tags
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 3. Test Case Generation Data Flow
- **Problem**: Potential mismatch between generation and consumption
- **Fix**: Verified structures match between `generate-test-cases` response and `AdvancedCodingQuestionBuilder` expectations
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

### 4. AI Skill Suggestion Flow
- **Problem**: Skills suggestion wasn't working due to body consumption error
- **Fix**: Now `useSkills.suggestSkillsForQuestion()` → `enhanced-ai-generator` → `autoTagQuestion()` works properly
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Expected Working Flow:

1. **Test Case Generation**: 
   - User clicks "AI Generate" in coding question builder
   - Calls `generate-test-cases` edge function
   - Returns test cases, starter code, hints, mistakes, and optimization tips
   - Updates the form with all generated content

2. **AI Skill Suggestion**:
   - User types question content
   - System automatically suggests relevant skills
   - Calls `enhanced-ai-generator` with `auto_tag` type
   - Returns array of suggested skills for the question

Both flows should now work without errors.
